# Estimating State Respondents to the 2022 ACS

This reflection provides an analysis using the 2022 ACS data from IPUMS.

The focus is on estimating the total number of respondents in each U.S. state (using the STATEICP variable) based on the number of respondents with a doctoral degree (EDUC variable) as their highest educational attainment. The estimation follows the ratio estimators approach of Laplace.
